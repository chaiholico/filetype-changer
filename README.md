overview:
here are my final and draft versions of the first 'project' i did in bash. the goal is to modify file extensions in a folder.

#version 1 : rename.sh
this one is the draft...doesn't rlly work.

#version 2 : rename3.sh
we don't speak of rename2.sh
anyway this one works, but it takes every file inside a parent folder and just that, no subdirectories

#version 3 : rename4.sh (wip)
still working on this, should recursively find every file even in subdirectories.
